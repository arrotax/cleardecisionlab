            <h1>You already lost<br>~$50,000 last year.</h1>
            
            <p class="subtitle">The deal you passed on. The decision you delayed. The move you didn't make.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">You did what you were supposed to do.</p>

            <p>You slowed down. Took breaks. Tried to reset.</p>

            <p>For a few days, it worked.</p>

            <p>Then everything came back.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">This isn't because you're weak.</p>

            <p>And it's not because you lack discipline.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>It's because you kept operating below your real capacity and calling it normal.</strong></p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">You thought it was temporary.</p>

            <p>You convinced yourself next week would be different. Next month. After this project ends.</p>

            <p>But the decisions kept piling up. The opportunities kept passing by.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 25px;">This is how capacity loss shows up in real life</h3>

            <p><strong>You delay decisions that used to be obvious.</strong><br>
            — Passing on deals or opportunities because evaluating them feels too heavy.<br>
            — Staying in a job you outgrew because interviewing or switching feels exhausting.</p>

            <p><strong>You accept pressure instead of correcting it.</strong><br>
            — Delaying a hire that would remove load.<br>
            — Taking on extra responsibilities instead of pushing back or renegotiating scope.</p>

            <p><strong>You settle for "good enough" instead of optimal.</strong><br>
            — Choosing safer, smaller moves instead of high-leverage ones.<br>
            — Accepting roles, shifts, or projects below your real level just to avoid friction.</p>

            <p><strong>You mistake slowdown for maturity.</strong><br>
            — Calling hesitation "being careful" or "strategic patience."<br>
            — Calling stagnation "stability" or "being realistic."</p>

            <p><strong>You lose money in different ways — but you lose it anyway.</strong><br>
            — Through missed upside, delayed growth, and weak execution.<br>
            — Through stalled income, missed raises, delayed transitions, and years spent below your actual level.</p>

            <div class="box" style="margin-top: 35px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Different roles. Same mechanism.</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Capacity loss always converts into money — either through missed upside or prolonged stagnation.</p>

                    <li><strong>$8,000:</strong> Revenue lost from underperformance in key client/customer interactions</li>
                    <li><strong>$5,000:</strong> Time wasted on low-value tasks because you lacked focus to prioritize effectively</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;">This doesn't include relationship damage, reputation costs, or the compounding effect of operating below capacity for years. This is what you already paid.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Pattern</h2>

            <p>You're still functioning. Meetings attended. Emails sent. Projects delivered.</p>

            <p>But decision quality has dropped. You're taking 3 days to make calls that used to take 3 hours. Missing opportunities that should have been obvious. Operating at 60% capacity while convincing yourself you're fine.</p>

            <p>The cost isn't visible in your calendar. It's visible in:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The deal you passed on because you didn't have mental bandwidth to evaluate it properly</li>
                <li>The hire you delayed because decision-making felt too heavy</li>
                <li>The strategic pivot you saw coming but were too depleted to execute</li>
                <li>The relationship damage from operating on autopilot for months</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why You Missed It</h2>

            <p>Capacity loss is invisible until the damage is done. Your system compensates by:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narrowing decision windows</strong> — You defer, delay, and avoid complex choices because processing them takes too much energy</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing signal detection</strong> — You miss opportunities and warnings that should trigger immediate action</li>
                <li><strong>Operating on autopilot</strong> — Default responses replace strategic thinking; you confuse routine execution with actual performance</li>
                <li><strong>Normalizing capacity loss</strong> — What used to feel sharp now feels "good enough"; you recalibrated baseline downward without noticing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You confuse degraded capacity with "not having time right now" when the real problem is you don't have processing power left.</p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <h2>The Three System Failures</h2>

            <p>Capacity loss isn't random. It follows predictable patterns based on which system is compromised:</p>

            <div class="system-box">
                <h4>Physical System Degradation</h4>
                <p><strong>Signal:</strong> Your nervous system is stuck in emergency mode. HRV is low. Sleep architecture is disrupted. Recovery capacity is offline.</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Decision-making requires more effort. Risk assessment becomes conservative or reckless (no middle ground). Physical symptoms appear: tension, digestive issues, immune suppression.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="system-box">
                <h4>Cognitive System Degradation</h4>
                <p><strong>Signal:</strong> Attention fragmentation. Task-switching costs accumulate. Working memory is overloaded. You can't hold complex problems in your head anymore.</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Strategic thinking becomes impossible. You default to reactive problem-solving. Planning horizons shrink from quarterly to weekly to daily.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="system-box">
                <h4>Emotional System Degradation</h4>
                <p><strong>Signal:</strong> Motivation system is offline. Nothing feels meaningful. You're going through motions. Values misalignment creates constant low-grade friction.</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Decision quality drops because you're operating without internal compass. You tolerate situations that violate your values because confronting them requires energy you don't have.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Generic Interventions Fail</h2>

            <p>You've tried meditation. Boundaries. Vacation. More sleep.</p>

            <p>None of it restored capacity because <span class="highlight">you treated symptoms instead of diagnosing which system actually failed.</span></p>

            <p>Physical system degradation doesn't respond to cognitive interventions. Cognitive overload doesn't respond to emotional work. Emotional depletion doesn't respond to physical protocols.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>The Pattern That Costs You Money:</strong><br><br>
                
                You implement generic "self-care" without understanding your failure mode → capacity doesn't improve → you conclude the problem is unsolvable → you accept degraded performance as permanent → opportunity cost compounds for years.
            </div>

            <h2>What Actually Restores Capacity</h2>

            <p><strong>1. Accurate diagnosis of which system is compromised</strong><br>
            Not "I'm depleted." But "My cognitive system is overloaded while my physical system is intact" or "My nervous system is dysregulated while cognitive function remains strong."</p>

            <p><strong>2. Targeted removal of what's actively degrading that specific system</strong><br>
            Not generic boundaries. But identifying the three specific patterns creating overload in YOUR system and eliminating them first.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Evidence-based restoration protocols matched to your failure pattern</strong><br>
            Not wellness tips. But clinical interventions from organizational psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral medicine that target the specific system that's offline.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Early detection system that prevents future degradation</strong><br>
            Not hoping you'll notice next time. But having a 2-minute monthly assessment that identifies warning signs before capacity loss becomes catastrophic.</p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <h2>The Protocol</h2>

            <p>If you're ready to stop operating at 60% capacity—to diagnose which system is actually failing and apply protocols that match your specific degradation pattern—you need structured detection and targeted correction.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>PERFORMANCE FAILURE MANUAL: Detection and Correction Protocol for High-Load Operations</strong></p>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">This is not a recovery guide. This is a detection and correction manual for people operating under constant load.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diagnoses your exact failure mode</strong> through a validated 3-system assessment (15 minutes, clinical precision)</li>
                <li><strong>Identifies specific capacity leaks</strong> so you stop applying interventions that don't match your degradation pattern</li>
                <li><strong>Provides immediate removal protocols</strong> that create capacity restoration within days—not months of trial and error</li>
                <li><strong>Rebuilds compromised systems</strong> with targeted restoration protocols matched to your diagnosis</li>
                <li><strong>Restores decision-making capacity</strong> so you stop leaving money on the table</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What You Get:</h3>

            <ul style="font-size: 16px;">
                <li><strong>The 15-Minute Diagnostic Assessment</strong> that identifies your primary system failure</li>
                <li><strong>Week 0: Immediate Correction Protocol</strong> — 3 removals that create capacity restoration this week</li>
                <li><strong>Week 1: Stop The Leak</strong> — Personalized removal strategies for your specific system degradation</li>
                <li><strong>Weeks 2-4: System Restoration</strong> — 5 core correction protocols (Sleep Architecture, Nervous System Reset, Attention Budget, Cognitive Offloading, Values Realignment)</li>
                <li><strong>Weeks 5-6: Protection Protocol</strong> — Early detection system that prevents future degradation</li>
                <li><strong>Your Complete Restoration Blueprint</strong> — One-page map of your system, warning signals, and reactivation triggers</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Toolkit</strong> — 5-minute interventions for acute capacity drops</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>The Timeline:</strong></p>

            <p>✅ Capacity restoration begins this week (immediate removal protocols)<br>
            ✅ Noticeable performance improvement by Week 2<br>
            ✅ Decision-making capacity restored by Week 4<br>
            ✅ Full system correction in 42 days<br>
            ✅ Detection framework for ongoing operation</p>

            <h3>Who This Is For:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>If you've tried generic interventions but you're still operating below capacity</li>
                <li>If you suspect your problem is system degradation, not temporary load</li>
                <li>If you're making worse decisions because you're depleted and it's costing you money</li>
                <li>If you're ready to diagnose the actual system failure instead of treating symptoms</li>

        <!-- P.S. Section -->
        <div class="ps-note">
            Every day you operate at 60% capacity, you're making worse decisions. Missing opportunities. Damaging relationships. Losing money.<br><br>

            <strong>The cost isn't the capacity loss. It's everything degraded capacity already cost you.</strong><br><br>

            Most people will read this, recognize the pattern, and do nothing. They'll go back to trying random solutions. They'll spend another year at 60% capacity, another $50,000 lost to poor performance and missed opportunities.<br><br>

            <strong>The question isn't whether you need correction. The question is whether you're ready to stop bleeding money.</strong><br><br>

            42 days from now, you could have your capacity back. Decision-making restored. Systems corrected. Opportunities you're currently too degraded to see become visible again.<br><br>

            Or you could still be here, operating at 60%, trying the next random solution. Still losing $50,000/year. Still convincing yourself it's normal.<br><br>

            The path to correction exists. The question is whether you'll take it before it costs you more.<br><br>

            <strong>Start with detection. Stop the loss.</strong>
